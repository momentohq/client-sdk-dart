# Running the Examples

For each example, you will need to provide a Momento API key, which you can generate from the [Momento Web Console](https://console.gomomento.com/).

Each subfolder has more specific instructions, but you can run examples in Dart files using `dart run <filename>` and start example Flutter apps using `flutter run -d <device_id>`.
